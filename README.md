# Basic Implementation of ZK Multisig Smart Contracts

This project consists of a basic implementation of ZK (Zero-Knowledge) multisig smart contracts.

The contracts are divided into two parts:

- **ZK Multisig Factory** - Manages and deploys multisig contracts.
- **ZK Multisig** - The implementation of the multisig contract itself.

For more details, refer to the documentation: [Link to Documentation]

   ```
